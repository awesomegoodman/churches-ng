# Nigeria Church Database

Welcome to the **Nigeria Church Database**, a community-driven initiative to build a public record of all churches in Nigeria. This project aims to gather and share data on churches across the country for research, networking, and better understanding of the religious landscape.

## Project Overview

This repository tracks the names of churches across Nigeria and allows users to contribute missing data. As we grow, we'll expand the data to include more details about each church, making it a valuable resource for researchers, scholars, and the public.

### How to Use

You can search for a church directly on `church-list.txt`, or via our live site: [Nigeria Church Search](https://awesomegoodman.vercel.app/church-search). Simply enter the name of the church you're looking for.

- If the church appears in the search results, we already have a record of it.
- If the church does not appear, please help us by adding it to the `church-list.txt` file.

### How to Contribute

If you find that a church is missing from our records, please:

1. Open the `church-list.txt` file in this repository.
2. Add the missing church name in any order.
3. Submit a pull request with your changes.

We're currently only tracking **names**, but in the future, the database will include more detailed information about each church.

### Future Data Structure

We are working towards a more robust data structure. The final church records will include the following details:

- **Name of church**: `string`  
- **Number of branches**: `int`  
- **Address of headquarters**: `string`  
- **Founder**: `string`  
- **Current overseer/senior pastor**: `string`  
- **Logo**: `string | Image`  
- **Category**: `string` (e.g., Catholic, Pentecostal, etc.)  
- **Estimated population of members**: `int`  

### How to Submit Suggestions
